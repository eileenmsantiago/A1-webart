      <p>We live in a world filled with technology. From mobile phones to robots, name anything, I bet you it’s made by technology. Don’t get me wrong, technology has advanced significantly and it has increased our productivity and efficiency in the tasks we are to do. Now, these are all the pros. What about the cons? You often hear how consumed we are on our phones, we’re almost like walking robots on our phones. The theme of “unseen” talks about the opportunities in life, beautiful places to visit and see, joyful moments with our loved ones – now those are the things that are unseen when all we do see is our phone screen.
        This webart depicts our human nature obsession to the apps on our phone. It walks you through the moment when we first hold our phone, the content we browse through (apps), with notifications by an outsider (Alexis) telling the user to get off their phone! And to simply put the phone down and embrace the moments, the scenery, and the life that’s ahead of them.</p>
      <p> Details about the web art: </p>
      <a href="index.html"><p>index.html</a> – a message about the unseen opportunities when constantly on our phones. Within this message, are keywords that is associated to the following pages (page2-phone, page3-vr, page4-reality, and page5-statement). These keywords are < a > tags that link to only the next page (page-2phone). The reason for this is for the user to only have the option of going to the next page. When you hover over to the write of the last paragraph positioned at the bottom of the page, a red turn off button will appear. After clicking this will lead the user to the reality page. When scrolling through index.html, even though all the words are linked to different pages, the purpose is to click on any word but will ultimately lead to the second page. Whereas, the turn off page brings you straight to the reality page.</p>
      </p>
      <a href="page1-phone.html"><p>page1-phone.html</a>– A user interface of an “iphone”. The user must click on the checkbox to proceed as the page is locked. Once clicked, a “slide to continue message will appear”. The user is able to hover over the main app with the red “1” notification badge to indicate the first clue. A notification will appear, prompting the user to check off the box in order to swipe to the next page. After doing so, hovering over the second red badge with a “2”, Alexa is messaging the user to enjoy nature and explore the world. There is a virtual reality app and the user is able to hover over that to head to the next page.
      </p>
      <a href="page2-vr.html"><p>Page2-vr.html</a> – A Virtual Reality game. The user is able to see animated nature of the sky scrolling all the way down to view mountains. In doing so, notifications appear from Alexa after the user scrolls through sections of the scenic background. These messages are trying to tell the user, “Seriously? A VR headset? That's your way of basking in reality?”. Once the user ends at the bottom, a final message from Alexa appears “ At the bottom yet? Find the exit in heights.”. The user is able to click around the tip of the mountain to proceed to the next page.
      </p>
      <a href="page3-password.html"><p>Page3-password.html</a> – Enter password from the index.html page “shutdown”. A red turn off button will appear and the user is to click on it to turn off their phone. This proceeds to the final page page4-reality.html.
      </p>
      <a href="page4-reality.html"><p>Page4-reality.html</a> – a quote by me stating the beauty of the world that’s available to us. This quote is encouraging and a simple message to just live in the moment and look at the beautiful things in front of you.
