        <p>It's easy to get caught in what we see on our <a href="page1-phone.html">phones</a> and in the midst of chaos when work and life gets busy... we turn to technology for <a href="page1-phone.html">temporary satisfaction</a> and relief, that we miss out on the little things in life.</p>
      <div class="para-1">
        <p>Maybe we're escaping from <a href="page1-phone.html">reality?</a></p>

        <div class="p-wrapper">
          <p>Sometimes when we're too focused on our devices, and we forget to live in the moment, the <a href="page1-phone.html">key</a> to life, is just to <i>shutdown</i> the device and look at the things in front of us. Those are what matter's the most, because what we do now, is a part of a memory we'll carry on with us forever in the future.</p>
